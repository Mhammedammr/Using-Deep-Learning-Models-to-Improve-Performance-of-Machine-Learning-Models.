# Using-Deep-Learning-Models-to-Improve-Performance-of-Machine-Learning-Models.

CNN used in the image recognition task have achieved superhuman visual pattern recognition in many controlled competitions. They have been successfully used in numerous tasks, such as biomedical image segmentation and image restoration, to name just a few. Perhaps most importantly, deep neural networks were used in the image recognition task, achieving superhuman visual pattern recognition in many controlled competitions. Such competitions, especially the ImageNet challenge, were the driving force behind the recent progress in neural-based models. Numerous novel architectures of deep neural networks gained their popularity based on the results achieved on the ImageNet benchmark. However, ImageNet consists of high quality images, while in the practical applications we are often faced with a low quality of images and the presence of factors such as a low resolution, noise, blur, compression and artifacts. It is unclear to what degree low image quality affects the performance of deep neural networks. In this paper we evaluate the impact of low resolution on the image recognition task, considering several most notable neural architectures, that is the MobileNet, VGGNet and ResNet and several datasets Linnaeus, Intel and LandScape. Furthermore, we evaluate the possibility of applying a neural-based super-resolution method, ESRGAN, to improve the classification accuracy for low resolution images.
